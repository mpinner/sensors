intent : 
 the tail operates in 3 modes : 
  UNTOUCHED - rainbow fades
  TOUCHED - single leds rainbow fading. the position is a meter of how much capacitance (how much/tightly it is grabbed)
  GRABBED - generally if two hands grab the tail the metter with count all the way to the top and go into this crazy stroby rainbow mode
  
  the button : 
   - changes the brightness
   - rezeros the threshold on the capacitance metering

 pins : 
  0 - touch sensor
  1 - button
  2 - data for ws2801 leds
  3 - clock for ws2801 leds
